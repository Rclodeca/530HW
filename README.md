Assignment #1, XBD  
README  

## Files Included
xbd.cpp, xbd.hpp, Makefile, README

## How to compile
* Navigate to the directory containing xbd.  
* Run `make`

## Operating Instructions
* use `-b` flag for binary output
* must include a file to be read as the last command line arg

## Extra Functionality
If an extra command line argument is used other than -b, it will be ignored and output will be in Hex

## Lessons Learned
We learned how to make a makefile, how to read bytes from a file, and we familiarized ourselves with c++.
